# diy.6axis_gamepad
Project for my own version of gamepad base on PS3 6axis gamepad controller hardware where main board has been replaced by custom PCB with STM32 onboard. ESP32 is used as adapter to connect main board (stm32) to any external client app using USB, BLE, or custom RF board. Communication with custom board is made by means of UART bus.
